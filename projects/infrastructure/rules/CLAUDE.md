Home lab, server, and workstation infrastructure management.

## Knowledge Loading

| Domain | Files | Load when... |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| IT Infrastructure | `~/.claude/domains/it-infrastructure/infra-protocol.md` | Working on infrastructure tasks |

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `session-context.md` | Current session state — **read first** |
| `backlog.md` | Prioritized task backlog |
| `infrastructure-map.md` | Auto-discovered network topology (from setup) |

## Rules

- Document all infrastructure changes before and after
- Never store credentials in plain text — use encrypted vaults
- Test changes in staging/parallel before cutting over
