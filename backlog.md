# Backlog — agent-fleet

## Open

- [ ] [P2] **Template testing + UX**: Test `setup.sh` end-to-end on a clean machine. Implement interactive mclaude-driven refinement after basic setup.
- [ ] [P3] **HTTPS to SSH**: Template was cloned via HTTPS — pushes need token/SSH. Set up SSH key or run vault deploy.

## Done

### 2026-02-25
- [x] Secrets scaffold — added `secrets/` with `vault-manage.sh`, `vault.json.example`, and `.gitignore`
- [x] Cross-project boundary rule — added to CLAUDE.md Rules for Claude section
- [x] Backlog migrated to standard format (P1-P5 tags, Open/Done sections)
